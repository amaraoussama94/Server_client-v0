NB: use Pycharme its the easiest way to test 2 client 
-This is a basic Server-Client  project using socket module and python 3
-This basic  server  sends  bytes (only position) this is why there's a change of  color of the same player in the different client window
-We send and receive string so  we need to encode and decode them
-Change Server IP  for  testing on your PC
1 run server
